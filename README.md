# WWDC 2016 Scholarship App - GitHub Version
APP MADE FOR WWDC 16 SCHOLARSHIP

This app was slightly edited for GitHub, as I don't want to share personal information.
Among the things changed:
Picture of me was replaced by a file from the Assets folder.
Removed biography (part of it will return eventually).
Removed education info (some will return eventually).
Different background

All of the things changed have not been changed in the version sent to Apple.

As a result of me removing this information, there is a small glitch within the app. Ignore this, it was not present in the version submitted to Apple.
