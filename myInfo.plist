		<string>I have a big dream and objective in my life:
   Use my creativity and my abilities to teach kids in my school how to code.

   With this opportunity there will be more programmers in my school and we together there will be more student programmers in the world.</string>

		<string>3 things that I really love:
  App Development, Music, and Writing.
   When I joined the iOS development program in 2013, the app development interest started to grow on me. When I started playing the piano in 2006,  I realized that music is amazing. That’s why I play many instruments. I’ve always been a great writer. That’s why I have a high average in English every semester. Every teacher I’ve had since 1st grade has commented on my writing skills.</string>

		<key>about</key>
		<string>In 2013, I got my first Mac and I immediately downloaded Xcode and registered for the iOS developer program, then a standalone program. In October 2013, I got a iPhone 5s, which I preferred over the iPhone 5c because of its processor and motion co-processor. That made it easier to test my apps. In December 2013, I made a simple speed-test app called Lagometer. I submitted it to the app store in March 2014, and since the app had a skeuomorphic design language (this is the language used from iOS 1 to iOS 6) instead of the flat language that Apple was pushing since iOS 7. I was discouraged, but not enough to stop developing altogether. I had heard on MacRumors that Apple might be introducing a new programming language at WWDC 14. I waited until June, and when I heard that Apple announced Swift, I immediately downloaded the Xcode beta and I’ve been using Swift ever since. In 2015, I got a iPhone 6s, and since Apple released Swift 2, I was able to make better apps with iOS 9. I also am a musician. I’ve been playing the piano since I was four, and since then, I’ve learned guitar, percussion, bass guitar, and cello. I was making electronic music on Logic Pro 9 until Logic Pro X came out, which is what I use today. I&apos;ve made just two completed apps since joining the program (not including this app) but many more ideas are either works in progress or in my head.</string>
